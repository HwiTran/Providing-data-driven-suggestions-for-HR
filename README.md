- 

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If I can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
