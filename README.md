# PROVIDING DATA DRIVEN SUGGESTION FOR HR 

## üì¶ Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **/data**: This directory contains the dataset.
- 

## üéØ Purpose
The goal in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If I can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset was taken from Kaggle. To see the dataset visit [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)  or you can find csv file in data folder.

There are 14,999 rows, 10 columns, and these variables:
- **satisfaction_level**: Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0‚Äì1]
- **last_evaluation**: Score of employee's last performance review [0‚Äì1]
- **number_project**: Number of projects employee contributes to
- **average_monthly_hours**: Average number of hours employee worked per month
- **time_spend_company**: How long the employee has been with the company (years)
- **Work_accident**: Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work

- **Department** The employee's department
- **salary**: The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)
